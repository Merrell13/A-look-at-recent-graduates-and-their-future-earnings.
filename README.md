Project Using Pandas and Matplotlib

A look at recent graduates and their future earnings.

In this project I will use Pandas plotting functionality to create scatter plots, histograms and bar charts to identify any trends between the choice of university major, gender and their subsequent earnings.

I'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.

Let's start by importing the necessary modules and reading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
